# ❄️ Fractol: Dive Into the World of Fractals! 🌌

Welcome to **Fractol**, a mesmerizing visual journey through **mathematical infinity**!  
Created as part of the **42 School** curriculum, this project challenges you to visualize **fractals** with precision, color, and interactive control – all in **pure C** with the **MiniLibX** graphical library.

---

## 🌟 What is Fractol?

**Fractol** is a program that generates and displays beautiful fractals such as:

🔹 **Mandelbrot Set**  
🔹 **Julia Set**  
🔹 **Burning Ship** (and more, if you dare to expand!)

The beauty lies in zooming, panning, and observing how infinite patterns emerge from simple equations.

## ❄️ Features

✨ Real-time interaction (zoom in/out, move across the fractal plane)  
🎨 Dynamic color palettes  
📌 Switch between multiple fractal types  
🚀 High-performance rendering with smooth animations  
🧠 A great exercise in complex numbers, graphical programming, and performance tuning!

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **C**
- **MiniLibX**
- **Makefile**
- **macOS / Linux** (X11 version for Linux)
- **Fractal Math** 🧮

## 🧭 How to Run

1️⃣ Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/the-snowflake-16/fractol.git
cd fractol
2️⃣ Compile the project:

bash
Copy
Edit
make
3️⃣ Run with a fractal name:

bash
Copy
Edit
./fractol mandelbrot
./fractol julia
./fractol burning_ship
🖱️ Controls:

Zoom: Scroll mouse or + / - keys

Move: Arrow keys

Change color scheme: C

Switch fractal (bonus): 1, 2, 3, etc.

Lock Julia movement (if implemented): L

❄️ The Magic Behind the Snowflakes
“Fractals are not just patterns. They are the fingerprints of God.” – Benoît Mandelbrot

This project taught me to see the beauty in code and math. Bit by bit, pixel by pixel – a whole universe emerges.
